# Hello-World
Getting into github &amp; coding as a female in the field. Feeling Awesome. Today is a good day to have a good day. Ps. 118:24

I love adventure, life and learning new things. I have high hopes for this coding world. Being able to change programs, websites, user interface and such from the inside out sounds fascinating and worth my time.
